/*
The `select()` function is used in socket programming to monitor multiple file descriptors (including sockets) and
determine which ones are ready for reading, writing, or have an exceptional condition. It allows you to efficiently
handle multiple I/O operations without blocking the execution of your program.

The `select()` function's prototype is as follows:

*/
int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
/*

The arguments of the `select()` function are:

1. `nfds` (int):
   The value of `nfds` is the highest-numbered file descriptor among the descriptors in the sets `readfds`, `writefds`,
   and `exceptfds`, plus 1. It specifies the range of descriptors to be checked. For example, if the highest-numbered
   file descriptor in any of the sets is `sockfd + 1`, you would pass `sockfd + 1` as the value of `nfds`.

2. `readfds` (fd_set *):
   The `readfds` parameter is a pointer to the set of file descriptors to be checked for readability. If any of the
   descriptors in this set are ready for reading (i.e., data is available to be read from them without blocking),
   `select()` will return.

3. `writefds` (fd_set *):
   The `writefds` parameter is a pointer to the set of file descriptors to be checked for writability. If any of the
   descriptors in this set are ready for writing (i.e., data can be written to them without blocking), `select()` will
   return.

4. `exceptfds` (fd_set *):
   The `exceptfds` parameter is a pointer to the set of file descriptors to be checked for exceptional conditions.
   These exceptional conditions may include out-of-band data, socket errors, or other exceptional events. If any of the
   descriptors in this set have exceptional conditions, `select()` will return.

5. `timeout` (struct timeval *):
   The `timeout` parameter is a pointer to a `struct timeval` that specifies the maximum time to wait for an event.
   It allows you to set a timeout value for `select()`. If `timeout` is set to `NULL`, `select()` will block indefinitely
   until an event occurs. Otherwise, if `timeout` is set to a non-NULL value, `select()` will wait until an event occurs
   or until the specified timeout expires.

After `select()` returns, you can check the file descriptor sets to determine which descriptors are ready.
You can use macros such as `FD_ISSET()` to check if a particular descriptor is ready for a specific operation
(read, write, or exceptional condition).

It's important to note that the `select()` function modifies the file descriptor sets (`readfds`, `writefds`,
`exceptfds`) to reflect the file descriptors that are ready. Therefore, you should reinitialize these sets before
each call to `select()`.

Additionally, `select()` returns the total number of ready descriptors in all the sets. If an error occurs, `-1`
is returned, and you can use `perror()` to print the corresponding error message.
